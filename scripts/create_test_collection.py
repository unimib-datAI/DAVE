"""
Example script: creates a collection and uploads a batch of test documents
into it as plain text, the same way the "Upload TXT" tab of the UI does -
Next.js runs the configured annotation pipeline and indexing itself, this
script just submits raw text.

This talks to the real HTTP surface of a running dev stack:
  - the Next.js app's tRPC API:
    - collection.create
    - document.createUploadJob (uploadType: "txt") - registers a background
      job that annotates each file (frontend/server/routers/document.ts's
      runAnnotateAndUpload, using the user's active pipeline configuration)
      and uploads/indexes the result, exactly like
      UploadDocumentsModal.tsx's handleUploadTXT.
    - document.getUploadJob - polled until the job finishes.

Requirements:
  pip install requests python-dotenv

Usage:
  python scripts/create_test_collection.py
  python scripts/create_test_collection.py --collection-name "My test set"
  DAVE_USERNAME=me@example.com DAVE_PASSWORD=hunter2 python scripts/create_test_collection.py
  DAVE_TOKEN=eyJ... python scripts/create_test_collection.py

Auth:
  Every tRPC call below accepts an optional `token` field (a Keycloak
  Bearer access token) instead of an Authorization header - that's how
  this app's resolvers read it. If the server you're targeting runs with
  USE_AUTH=false (typical local dev), leave all three unset and requests
  are treated as an anonymous user with full access.

  Otherwise, either:
  - set DAVE_USERNAME/DAVE_PASSWORD (or --username/--password) and this
    script logs in for you via POST /api/auth/keycloak-login (Keycloak's
    Resource Owner Password Credentials grant - the same one
    lib/documentsBackend/keycloakService.ts's loginUser() performs), or
  - set DAVE_TOKEN directly if you already have an access token.
